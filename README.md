# Horison Project

## Project
This is the proposal that I made for the company Horiseon so below are the requirements of the client

## User Story Provided for the client

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Code Changes

The web application's appearance and functionality are the same that the original but now with the correct Tags HTML and usign the best practices with CSS:


```
Added the Header, Footer and Main Tag
Added the Section and Articules Tags 
Added the Figure tags with their subtags as Figcaption 
Optimized the CSS code in order to avoid duplicate properties on elements that share those properties
```

## Website View
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/readme/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: The layout designed for Horiseon was not change on terms view , all the changes have been on de HTML code and on the CSS code.
